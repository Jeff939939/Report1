<p>Social media is a let’s just say special place where people lie and say what ever they want because there isn’t any consequences for it. But it is a double-edged sword people being able to express their opinion to lots of people. But that’s kind of rare compared to what it mostly is. A place for people to make themselves feel better, on both sides. The people who create the content want to make themselves feel better and the people who watch/see that content want to feel better by watching/viewing it. But most of the time it makes them feel worse.

<p>This is why petter Dutton the leader of the Crap party (the liberals) has proposed a possibly good policy for once in the party’s history and the Less Crap party (the Labor party) agrees. The policy is that social media will be banned for people under the age of 16.

<p>The US surgeon general has called for a health label on social media due to the mental effects. Let me list a few of them: FOMO, “people have so much better lives than me,” , “someone said something I don’t agree with WAAAAAAA,” , “WAAAAAAA this man insulted me with no consequences”.
